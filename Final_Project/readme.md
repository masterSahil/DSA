Singly Linked List in C++ (Menu-Driven Program)
This C++ project implements a menu-driven singly linked list with various operations including:

Node creation

Traversal

Modification

Binary search (on sorted array derived from the list)

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

The project provides an interactive console interface for practicing and understanding linked list concepts.

🚀 Features
Create Linked List
Add multiple nodes by specifying size and values.

Traverse Linked List
Display the elements of the linked list.

Modify Node
Update the value of a node at a specific position.

Binary Search
Convert the list into an array, sort it, and perform binary search to find a value's original position.

Merge Sort
Sort the list using merge sort algorithm.

Quick Sort
Sort the list using quick sort algorithm.

Clear List
Destructor handles memory management by deallocating all nodes.

Pointers & Dynamic Memory

Linked List Traversal

Linked List Modification

Merge Sort on Linked List

Quick Sort on Linked List

Binary Search on Array

Menu-driven programming in C++

🛠️ How to Run
Requirements:
A C++ compiler (like g++, clang++, or MSVC)

g++ -o LinkedList main.cpp
./LinkedList

Example Menu:
== Linked List Menu ==
1. Show Linked List
2. Create Linked List
3. Update Linked List
4. Binary Search
5. Merge Sort
6. Quick Sort
0. Exit

💡 Usage Tips
Always use Option 2 (Create) before trying other operations.

Use Merge Sort or Quick Sort before performing Binary Search to ensure sorted data.

Use Option 1 (Show) after any operation to verify results.
