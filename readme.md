# 📚 DSA Mastery – Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

Welcome to **DSA Mastery**, your personal collection of hands-on **DSA practice programs** built using **C++**. This repository is a structured compilation of logic-based exercises and fundamental concepts meant to boost your problem-solving skills and strengthen your core programming foundation.

> This main repository includes three dedicated sub-projects:
> - 🔀 **Assortment** – Core logic & array-based problems
> - 🌀 **Circlet** – Pattern printing challenges
> - 🔁 **Looper** – Loop-focused logic problems

## 🧩 Project Structure

DSA/ 
├── assortment/ # Core logic and array manipulation 
├── circlet/ # Creative and mathematical patterns 
└── looper/ # Loop-based logic and counting problems
